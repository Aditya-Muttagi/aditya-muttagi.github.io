  <h1>Turning questions into decisions</h1>

    A few examples of how I approach product and data problems — from scoping the question,
    to structuring the analysis, to turning it into a narrative stakeholders can act on.

        <h3>The context</h3>
        <p>
          A multi-step onboarding flow had healthy top-of-funnel traffic but poor completion.
          Different teams had different hypotheses, but there was no single, trusted view of
          where users were dropping off.
        </p>

        <h3>What I did</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Mapped the full user journey with clear event definitions</li>
          <li>Built a stepwise funnel and quantified drop-offs at each stage</li>
          <li>Segmented by device and traffic source to spot patterns</li>
          <li>Framed a concise “problem slide” for alignment</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>How I approached it</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Made sure the funnel definition and event quality were solid first</li>
          <li>Avoided over-segmentation until the base picture was stable</li>
          <li>Turned scattered hypotheses into a prioritised list of UX changes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>
          Teams aligned on two high-friction steps to address first, instead of debating
          intuitions. Follow-up experiments were scoped with realistic expectations on impact.
        </p>

    <div class="project-columns">
      <div>
        <h3>The context</h3>
        <p>
          Leadership wanted to “improve retention”, but there was no shared definition of
          what a “retained user” was, or which early behaviours predicted it.
        </p>

        <h3>What I did</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Defined retention and what counted as meaningful activity</li>
          <li>Built weekly cohorts and plotted retention curves</li>
          <li>Segmented by acquisition channel and early usage patterns</li>
          <li>Identified behaviours linked with better long-term use</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>How I approached it</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Started with business reality: which behaviours actually matter</li>
          <li>Made trade-offs explicit (activity vs. real engagement)</li>
          <li>Annotated charts with plain-language explanations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>
          The team refined its activation metric, focused onboarding on a small set of
          “healthy behaviours”, and had a clearer baseline for retention experiments.
        </p>

    <div class="project-columns">
      <div>
        <h3>The context</h3>
        <p>
          Stakeholders were receiving multiple reports with different metrics,
          definitions, and time windows. Meetings were spent reconciling numbers,
          not deciding what to do.
        </p>

        <h3>What I did</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Audited existing reports and reconciled metric definitions</li>
          <li>Agreed on a concise set of core product and operational metrics</li>
          <li>Designed a single weekly “source of truth”</li>
          <li>Added commentary templates for context and caveats</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>How I approached it</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Optimised for clarity and consistency over metric volume</li>
          <li>Worked closely with stakeholders on what they actually use</li>
          <li>Kept maintenance overhead low so the view stayed alive</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>
          Leadership had one trusted file to review weekly. Decision time shortened
          and ad-hoc number disputes dropped sharply.

          <li>Focus: metric design, stakeholder communication</li>
