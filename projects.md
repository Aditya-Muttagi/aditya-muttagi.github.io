# Projects

Each project is written like a compact case study: **context → approach → outcome**.

---

## 1. Customer Churn Analysis

**Context:**  
Subscription-based client seeing unexplained drop-offs in renewals.

**Approach:**  
- Collected historical customer and transaction data  
- Defined clear churn definitions and time windows  
- Built simple segmentation + descriptive analysis  
- Highlighted a few interpretable drivers instead of a black-box model

**Outcome:**  
- Isolated 2–3 high-risk cohorts  
- Provided a short decision-oriented deck for management  
- Enabled targeted retention actions for high-value accounts

## 2. Reporting Automation for Ops Team

**Context:**  
Weekly performance reporting was manual, error-prone, and slow.

**Approach:**  
- Mapped current reporting flow end-to-end  
- Standardised source data inputs  
- Built a semi-automated template (Excel / Python / any tools you used)  
- Documented the process so others could maintain it

**Outcome:**  
- Reduced manual effort by ~X hours per week  
- Fewer last-minute report issues  
- Clear ownership and documentation

## 3. Performance Dashboard (Experiment)

**Context:**  
Leadership needed a quick view of operational health.

**Approach:**  
- Identified 5–7 key KPIs worth tracking  
- Mocked up a simple dashboard (can mention tool: Power BI / Excel / Google Data Studio)  
- Focused on trend + targets, not just raw numbers

**Outcome:**  
- Prototype used in discussions to refine what really matters  
- Foundation for a more robust monitoring setup
