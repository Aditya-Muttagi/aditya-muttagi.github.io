Each project is written like a compact case study: <strong>context → approach → outcome</strong>.

    <p class="project-tag">Customer Analytics</p>
    <h2 class="project-title">Customer Churn Analysis</h2>
    <p class="project-meta">Subscription-based client · 2024</p>

    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
    <p>
      A subscription client was seeing unexplained drop-offs in renewals and had
      no consistent way to identify at-risk customers.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collected and cleaned historical customer and transaction data</li>
      <li>Defined a clear churn window and simple, interpretable segments</li>
      <li>Explored key drivers with intuitive charts for leadership</li>
      <li>Summarised insights in a short, decision-oriented deck</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="project-outcome"><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
    <p>
      Isolated a set of high-risk cohorts, highlighted the behaviours linked to churn,
      and gave leadership a practical way to prioritise retention actions for the most
      valuable segment.

  <article class="project-card" id="operations-reporting-automation">
    <p class="project-tag">Reporting & Automation</p>
    <h2 class="project-title">Operations Reporting Automation</h2>
    <p class="project-meta">Internal project</p>

    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
    <p>
      Weekly performance reporting was manual, error-prone, and dependent on a
      small group of people who understood the process.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mapped the end-to-end reporting flow and identified failure points</li>
      <li>Standardised source data, file naming and folder structure</li>
      <li>
        Built a semi-automated template (Excel / scripts) to refresh outputs with
        minimal manual intervention
      </li>
      <li>Documented the process so ownership could be shared across the team</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="project-outcome"><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
    <p>
      Reduced manual effort per cycle, decreased last-minute fixes before reviews,
      and made the reporting process easier to hand over and maintain.

  <article class="project-card" id="performance-monitoring-dashboard">
    <p class="project-tag">Dashboarding</p>
    <h2 class="project-title">Performance Monitoring Dashboard (Prototype)</h2>
    <p class="project-meta">Concept / prototype</p>

    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
    <p>
      Leadership needed a single place to understand operational health across
      teams without digging through multiple spreadsheets.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identified a small, meaningful set of KPIs tied to business outcomes</li>
      <li>Mocked up a lightweight dashboard (Power BI / Sheets / other tool)</li>
      <li>Focused on trends, targets, and alerts instead of dense tables</li>
      <li>Used feedback from stakeholders to refine metrics and views</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="project-outcome"><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
    <p>
      The prototype became a discussion tool for aligning on which metrics
      actually matter, and a starting point for a more robust monitoring setup.
