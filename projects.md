      <h2>Customer Churn Analysis</h2>
      <p class="project-one-liner">
        Helped a subscription client understand **who is likely to churn and why**, in a way leadership could act on.
      </p>
    </header>

    <dl class="project-body">
      <dt>Context</dt>
      <dd>
        Subscription-based client seeing unexplained drop-offs in renewals, with no consistent view of at-risk customers.
      </dd>

      <dt>Approach</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Collected and cleaned historical customer and transaction data from multiple sources.</li>
          <li>Defined a clear churn window and simple segments instead of a black-box model.</li>
          <li>Explored key drivers (tenure, activity, complaints, discounts, etc.) with intuitive visuals.</li>
          <li>Summarised findings in a short, decision-oriented deck for non-technical stakeholders.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>Outcome</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Isolated 2–3 high-risk cohorts with significantly higher churn probability.</li>
          <li>Enabled targeted retention actions for the top value segment.</li>
          <li>Created a repeatable template for running the analysis on future cohorts.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Operations Reporting Automation</h2>
      <p class="project-one-liner">
        Turned a fragile, manual weekly report into a **repeatable and documented reporting flow**.
      </p>
    </header>

    <dl class="project-body">
      <dt>Context</dt>
      <dd>
        Ops team spending several hours each week preparing performance reports using copy-paste in Excel.
      </dd>

      <dt>Approach</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Mapped the existing reporting process end-to-end and identified failure points.</li>
          <li>Standardised data inputs and naming conventions across teams.</li>
          <li>Built a semi-automated template (e.g. formulas / macros / scripts) for recurring calculations and visuals.</li>
          <li>Documented the process so it can be owned by the team, not a single individual.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>Outcome</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced manual effort by several hours per week.</li>
          <li>Lower error rate and fewer last-minute fixes before leadership reviews.</li>
          <li>Clear versioning and easier onboarding for new team members.</li>

      <h2>Operational KPI Dashboard (Concept)</h2>
      <p class="project-one-liner">
        Designed a **lightweight KPI dashboard** to keep leadership aligned on operational health.

    <dl class="project-body">
      <dt>Context</dt>
      <dd>
        Senior stakeholders lacked a single view of volume, SLA adherence, and backlog across processes.
      </dd>

      <dt>Approach</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Worked with stakeholders to shortlist a small set of meaningful KPIs.</li>
          <li>Prototyped a dashboard (e.g. in Power BI / Excel / Data Studio) with trends, targets, and simple colour cues.</li>
          <li>Focused on “what to look at weekly” rather than overwhelming users with every metric.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>Outcome</dt>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Prototype used to drive conversations on what truly matters in performance reviews.</li>
          <li>Provided a blueprint for a more robust, automated monitoring setup.</li>
