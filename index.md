## Case Study Highlights

These are examples of the type of work I do or want to specialise in.  
Each one is written like a product case study: **context → approach → impact**.

### Feature Adoption & Activation

Analysed how new users interacted with a key feature to understand why activation lagged behind sign-ups.

- Defined an activation metric aligned with product value  
- Built a simple funnel from sign-up → activation → repeat usage  
- Identified friction points and user segments with low completion

### Conversion Funnel Deep-Dive

Looked at a sign-up → subscription funnel to find where users were dropping and why.

- Broke the journey into clear steps with drop-off at each stage  
- Compared funnel by device, traffic source and cohort  
- Produced a prioritised list of fixes and quick experiments

### Retention & Cohort View

Explored how retention behaved across different user cohorts.

- Built basic cohort tables and visualised retention curves  
- Looked at differences by acquisition channel and early behaviour  
- Suggested instrumentation / event improvements to track retention better
