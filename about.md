  <h1>Who I am and how I think about data</h1>
  <p class="hero-subtitle narrow">
    I sit at the intersection of operations, product, and data —
    comfortable with messy reality, but ruthless about clarity when
    it comes to metrics and decisions.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I started in operations and analytics, working with imperfect instrumentation,
      legacy processes, and constraints that don’t exist in slideware. That forced me
      to focus on analysis that is <strong>good enough to make a decision</strong>,
      not academically perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, I moved closer to product questions:
      which journeys matter, how to define “healthy usage”, and what metrics
      leadership should look at every week.

    <h2>How I approach product problems</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li><strong>Start with the decision.</strong> What will we do differently based on this?</li>
      <li><strong>Define the metric.</strong> Does it represent real user or business value?</li>
      <li><strong>Respect constraints.</strong> Be explicit about data quality & blind spots.</li>
      <li><strong>Tell a tight story.</strong> One clear narrative beats ten loose charts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What it’s like to work with me</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>Push back on vague asks and help reframe them into testable questions</li>
      <li>Structured communication, especially with non-technical stakeholders</li>
      <li>Bias towards reusable queries / views instead of one-off analysis</li>
      <li>Honest about what the data can and cannot say</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outside of work</h2>
    <p>
      I like understanding systems — products, organisations, or processes —
      and writing short, opinionated notes about analytics practice:
      what actually works day-to-day versus what just sounds good.
