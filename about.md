  <h1>Who I am and how I think about data</h1>
  <p class="hero-subtitle narrow">
    I sit at the intersection of operations, product, and data — comfortable with messy reality,
    but ruthless about clarity when it comes to metrics and decisions.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I started in operations and analytics, working with imperfect instrumentation,
      legacy processes, and constraints you never see in slideware.
    </p>
    <p>
      That forced me to focus on analysis that is <strong>good enough to make a decision</strong>,
      not academically perfect. Over time I moved closer to product questions:
      which journeys matter, how to define “healthy usage”, and what metrics leadership
      should look at every week.

    <h2>How I approach product problems</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li><strong>Start with the decision.</strong> What changes based on this analysis?</li>
      <li><strong>Define the metric carefully.</strong> Does it represent real value?</li>
      <li><strong>Respect constraints.</strong> Be explicit about data quality & blind spots.</li>
      <li><strong>Tell a tight story.</strong> One clear narrative beats ten loose charts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What it’s like to work with me</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>Push back on vague asks and help reframe them into testable questions</li>
      <li>Structured communication with non-technical stakeholders</li>
      <li>Bias towards reusable queries and views instead of one-off analysis</li>
      <li>Honest about what the data can and cannot say</li>
    </ul>

  <article class="info-card">
    <h2>Outside of work</h2>
    <p>
      I like understanding systems — products, organisations, or processes — and writing
      short notes about analytics practice: what actually works day-to-day versus
      what just looks good in frameworks.
