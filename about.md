I’m Aditya, a consultant at EXL working at the intersection of **operations, analytics, and reporting**.

## How I Work

- Start by clarifying vague requirements into sharp, solvable questions  
- Prefer simple, repeatable analytical flows over over-engineered one-offs  
- Communicate in plain language so non-technical stakeholders can actually use the output  

## What I’ve Worked With

- **Domains:** customer analytics, operations performance, reporting automation  
- **Tools:** Excel, Power BI / dashboarding, SQL / Python (adjust this to your real stack)  
- **Typical outputs:** decision decks, recurring reports, monitoring views, prototypes for dashboards  

## Where This Site Is Going

Over time, this will become a record of:

- Projects I’ve shipped  
- Small experiments in automation and dashboards  
- Frameworks I find useful for breaking down messy business problems
