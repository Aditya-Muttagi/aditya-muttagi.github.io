  <h1>Who I am and how I think about data</h1>
  <p class="hero-subtitle narrow">
    I’m Aditya, currently a consultant at EXL, moving deeper into 
    <strong>product and data analytics</strong>.  
    I enjoy taking noisy, operational reality and turning it into 
    calm, practical insight for product teams.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I started in operations and analytics, working with messy, real-world data —
      far from ideal instrumentation and far from “perfect” experiments.
      That environment forced me to be pragmatic: ship analysis that’s
      <strong>good enough to make a decision</strong>, not theoretically perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, I shifted closer to product questions:
      which journeys matter, which metrics actually capture user value, and how to
      communicate findings to stakeholders who don’t live inside SQL all day.

    <h2>How I approach product problems</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li><strong>Start with the decision.</strong> I clarify what will change based on the analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Define the metric.</strong> I care a lot about whether we’re measuring the right thing.</li>
      <li><strong>Respect constraints.</strong> I’m explicit about assumptions and data quality issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Tell a tight story.</strong> I prefer one clear narrative over ten loose charts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What it’s like to work with me</h2>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
      <li>Honest about what data can and cannot say</li>
      <li>Comfortable pushing back on vague asks and reframing them</li>
      <li>Structured in communication, especially with non-technical stakeholders</li>
      <li>Bias towards creating simple, re-usable views instead of one-off queries</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Outside of work</h2>
      <p>
        I like understanding systems: products, organisations, or processes.
        I also enjoy writing short, opinionated notes about analytics practice —
        what actually works day-to-day versus what looks good in frameworks.
