# About

I’m Aditya, a consultant at EXL, currently working at the intersection of operations, analytics, and reporting.

I enjoy:
- Clarifying vague requirements into well-defined questions
- Building simple analytical flows instead of over-engineered solutions
- Communicating insights in a way that busy stakeholders can actually use

Over time, I want this site to become a living record of:
- Projects I’ve shipped  
- Ideas and frameworks that I find useful  
- Small experiments around automation, dashboards, and decision-support tools
