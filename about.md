I’m Aditya, currently a consultant at EXL, moving deeper into **product and data analytics**.

My background is in operations and analytics, working with messy, real-world data and decision-makers who don’t have time for theory. I’m most comfortable at the point where product questions meet data:

- “Where exactly are users dropping in this journey and why?”  
- “What should we actually measure to know if this feature is working?”  
- “How can we track this in a way that is repeatable, not one-off?”

## How I Approach Product Problems

- Start from the **product goal** and the decision that needs to be made  
- Translate that into clear metrics, events, and hypotheses  
- Use simple, explainable analysis before jumping to complexity  
- Present findings so that a PM or business stakeholder can act on them quickly  

## Skills & Tools

Adjust this to match reality:

- **Analysis:** funnel analysis, cohorts, segmentation, retention, basic experimentation  
- **Tools:** Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI / dashboards, Google Analytics / product analytics tools  
- **Outputs:** case-study decks, recurring product/ops reports, dashboards, prototypes

## This Site

This site is where I:

- Publish **case studies** for product analyst roles  
- Share structured write-ups of problems I’ve worked on or simulated  
- Keep an up-to-date **resume** and a portfolio I can share with teams
