    <h2>Email</h2>
    <p>
      The most reliable way to reach me is by email.
      I usually respond with a short, direct reply rather than a long essay.

    <h2>LinkedIn</h2>

      For roles or collaborations, you can also reach out via LinkedIn with a brief,
      concrete description of what you’re working on.
